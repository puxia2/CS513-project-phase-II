Queries :

Integrity Constraint Check : 

1) Check primary key constraints for all four tables prior to data cleaning.

ALTER TABLE dish
ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
SHOW KEYS FROM dish WHERE Key_name = 'PRIMARY';

ALTER TABLE menu
ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
SHOW KEYS FROM  menu WHERE Key_name = 'PRIMARY';

ALTER TABLE menuitem
ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
SHOW KEYS FROM menuitem WHERE Key_name = 'PRIMARY';

ALTER TABLE menupage
ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
SHOW KEYS FROM menupage WHERE Key_name = 'PRIMARY';


Results: Primary key is successfully set for all four tables. Manual review confirmed there's no duplication for the id column. 
Action: No action.

2) Check non-null constraints for the id columns of all four tables. 

SELECT * FROM dish
WHERE id IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM menu
WHERE id IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM menuitem
WHERE id IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM menupage
WHERE id IS NULL;

Results: 0 row(s) returned for all 4 tables. 
Action: No action.

3) An example query to find the most expensive breakfast dish from 2012 to 2024:
SELECT
    dc.id AS dish_id,
    dc.name AS dish_name,
    mf.event,
    dc.first_appeared,
    dc.last_appeared,
    MAX(mif.price) AS max_price
FROM
    cs531.dish_final dc
JOIN
    cs531.menuitem_final mif ON dc.id = mif.dish_id
JOIN
    cs531.menupage_final mpf ON mpf.id = mif.menu_page_id
JOIN
    cs531.menu_final mf ON mpf.menu_id = mf.id
WHERE
    dc.first_appeared < 2012 AND
    dc.last_appeared < 2024 AND
    mf.event LIKE '%BREAKFAST%'
GROUP BY
    dc.id, dc.name, mf.event, dc.first_appeared, dc.last_appeared
ORDER BY
    max_price DESC
LIMIT 1;
